                        Basketball Tryouts
                        Nov 5, 2024
                        I (Jeffrey) decided to participate in the basketball tryouts to represent BSIT
                        for the Sinag Sports Event that held at FEU Cainta. 
                        Unfortunately, I wasn't chosen because there are players who are better than me, but it's only my
                        first year, so I'm not rushing. I know my time will come, and I'll get the chance to represent T'BOLI.
                        Not now, but hopefully in the coming years at FEUR.

                        Volleyball Tryouts
                        Nov 5, 2024
                        I (Lui) decided to participate in the volleyball tryouts to represent BSIT
                        for the Sinag Sports Event that was held at FEU Cainta. The tryouts were
                        quite upsetting because of the lack of preparations and short tryout 
                        time span. We were only able to do serves, receives, and spikes. We
                        didn't do blocking drills and we didn't have a full game try outs 
                        because it was cut short due to Ms. Sarah ending the tryouts 30mins early.

                        Nov 22, 2024
                        After fighting their way up in the loser's bracket, the T'boli Volleyball's 
                        team were face to face again with Mangyan in the Championship
                        round. Their battle lasted 3 sets with Manyang taking the win.

                        Nov 15, 2024
                        We decided to take a picture of our hands wearing the concert ticket to preserve the memory 
                        and also because tickets' design was so beautiful.

                        Sinag Tamaraw Concert
                        Nov 15, 2024
                        During the Pageant, as the muses and escorts were showcasing their talents, we decided to take
                        pictures at the back due to the hot weather and the open space of the venue. We also saw Sir Roel,
                        so we took the opportunity to have a photo with him during the SINAG TAMARAW CONCERT."

                        After the Battle of Muse and Escort, the concert started before sunset 
                        around 4pm. The concert featured Lampara, Avi, We Just Changed, 
                        Simpatiko PH, Kiyo, and the Sugarcane. The concert ended well into the 
                        night around 9:30PM followed by the fireworks show to mark the 
                        memorable night it was.

Between finishing assignments, studying for exams, and wrapping up projects, it can feel like a hectic time, but there's still a sense of excitement in the air. Classrooms are filled with festive decorations, and many teachers bring in treats or plan holiday-themed activities to keep spirits high. Despite the workload, it’s hard not to get caught up in the cheerful anticipation of the season, whether it's the thought of holiday traditions, gift exchanges, or simply a break from school. In the end, it's a mix of stress and joy, and everyone is ready for a little rest and time with family.</p>

            At the start of the project, we were full of excitement and had countless ideas for the website.<br> We were eager to dive in, so we spent a lot of time watching website animations for inspiration. However, only a handful of those ideas made it to the final product.<br> The biggest challenge we faced was balancing the overwhelming number of ideas with the uncertainty of where to begin.<br> Despite the excitement, it was difficult to focus and prioritize, which made the process of starting feel both overwhelming and exciting at the same time
